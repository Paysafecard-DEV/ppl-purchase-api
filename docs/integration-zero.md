# Integrations: Zero integration

The zero integration allows for instore payments without any integration with one of your systems. The only thing needed is access to the webapp of Paysafe. (Contact your account manager for details on the webapp)

### 1. Create transaction
The flow starts with logging into the webapp of Paysafe and creating a new transaction. An amount and customer phone number must be provided to create the transaction.

### 2. Customer application
Once the transaction has been created in the webapp, the customer will receive an SMS with a link. This link will take the customer through a series of screens, on their device, for the customer to provide additional details. At the end of the customer application, a confirmation number will be presented.

### 3. Finalize transaction
The customer comes back with the confirmation number and can be validated in the Paysafe webapp to complete the sale.
